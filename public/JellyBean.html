  <p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was fourth grade. You know that time. Boys were starting to like girls and girls were starting to like girls. I was on the fence. I guess you could say I didn&#39;t understand what was so great about girls. &nbsp;I was thinning out though. The old baby fat on my face, all gone. The portly round to my stomach, almost like it was never there. Four years later, I was to grow another two feet and add a clear hundred pounds of muscle. But today, I was just cute Davey, not yet strong David. &nbsp;But that was me, not my best friend James. He was still growing outward in most places, including his belly and face. His stomach and upper body bulged outward but his midsection just didn&#39;t understand what was going on. Sometimes I&#39;d hear my parents talk about it in hushed tones. They talked about his jeans. I didn&#39;t really understand how his jeans could change how he grew up, but I asked James if he wanted a pair of mine anyways. We couldn&#39;t get them to fit and I remember thinking how that wasn&#39;t fair. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the day we were born two hospital rooms over, we had spent a lot of time together. He lived a short bike ride away and everyone else I knew from school lived a good mile or so out there. You&#39;d ride and ride and just about never get to their house. But I could count on James being really close since the time I was a little boy. We played with toy soldiers a lot still. He had this big marble and we&#39;d set up opposing armies and take turns rolling the marble into each others&#39; forces. The end was always the best part as I tried to knock over his last general, this really thin civil war soldier that he liked to use way in the back. It was almost like he was cheating. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But anyways, so this memory is one that always stuck with me. It was fourth grade, and we were playing on the playground. Suzie and Jessie, the mean girls, were there, but so was Russel. Russel was the most athletic guy in our class. He could kick that ball for a home run pretty much every time. Afterward, I&#39;d always be there at home plate waiting to give him a high five. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James and I were playing with the sand. I think we might have been building a bad sandcastle, but really, we were just laughing a lot. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The next moment is as clear as any in my mind. Suzie ran by giggling. James didn&#39;t see her and moved slightly into her path, and whoosh, she went flying just about into outer space. Suzie was a small thing and James, well, James was big. He couldn&#39;t help but send her flying into the sand. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I busted out laughing. But then Suzie got up. And she stormed right up to James&#39;s face and started yelling at him, calling him names. &ldquo;Watch where you&#39;re going ya big oaf. You&#39;re so stupid. Gosh, you&#39;re stupid! I&#39;m running here, so stay out of my way, fatso.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She kept on going too. Of course, this attracted some attention, including Russel&#39;s. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Russel was one of those guys who had a thing for girls even then. And his first thing was for Suzie. &ldquo;What happened Suzie?&rdquo; he asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;This fatso knocked me over and got my shoes all sandy and my hair all ruined.&rdquo; She pointed at James. &ldquo;Fatso! Fatso!&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;James just looked down at the ruined sandcastle. He should defend himself I thought.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;What&#39;d you do that for fatso?&rdquo; Russel asked. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh Russel, I thought. Not you too. But yeah, that was strong, athletic, already-getting-girls Russel degrading my best friend from all my life. </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Whatever, Suzie, let&#39;s just leave this jellybean alone. He&#39;s a loser.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, what a loser bean.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Hey James, you ok?&rdquo; I asked him after they left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yeah, I&#39;m alright.&rdquo; But he paused. &ldquo;Hey, why didn&#39;t you say anything?&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mind was racing and I didn&#39;t know what to say. &ldquo;Uh, well, Russel said, I mean, you do sort of look like a jellybean.&rdquo; </span></p><p class="c0"><span></span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;That was what you said?&rdquo; Steve asked me incredulously.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Yep,&quot; I sighed, &quot;that&#39;s what I came up with.&quot; I turned to Steve lying face-up on the sand with his hands crossed over his chest. &quot;Sometimes I wonder what exactly James thought at that instant. It had to have been the worst for a kid that age.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ten feet ahead, the waves were crashing the shore as the rising sun illuminated the horizon with a brilliant yellow spotlight.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Wow.&rdquo; His eyes were wide and mouth slightly agape. We just lay there taking in the cool ocean breeze. &quot;Well, alright, you shared. Now I suppose it&rsquo;s my turn to share when I first knew.&quot; </span></p><p class="c1"><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yeah. Yeah, I&rsquo;d like that.&quot; I smiled and glanced ahead at the horizon. &quot;But wait. We made it. Look.&quot; I pointed at the sky, pulled Steve close, and kissed my memories away.</span></p>
