<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ping. </div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was an Ansible message. Oliver read the title, "Request from Source", before brushing it away. He returned to perusing Reddit.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ping. </div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Another message. He checked the title again as his hand motioned to brush it away, "Request from Source". He paused his hand and stiffened. While it wasn't uncommon to receive two requests for attention in so short a time, it was unheard of to receive the same one twice at all. He recalled the first request from archive and squinted at them both together. </div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ansible Request For Attention</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Title: Request From Source</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Time: 01:22:14-11.08.2042</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ansible Request For Attention</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Title: Request From Source</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Time: 01:22:43-11.08.2042</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; He rubbed his eyes and reached for his cup. "I don't understand," he muttered. "Am I imagining this?"</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; . . .</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The Ansible network was developed as a joint operation between China, America, and SilverStoneSearch, the poorly named technical giant that discovered how to value and market focus. The principle behind it was that earning money was a derivative of how much value one generated but which itself was a consequence of three qualities. The first were our genetic traits. The second was the degree to which we understand those traits. And the third was the focus with which we bring to each individual task.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The seventh amendment to the Stockholm Plenum enforced the arbitrariness of one's skills while society's understanding of one's abilities continued to be problematic. Dr. Hauser of the famed Jackson Brown Clinic commented that in studies of patients between five years of age and thirty-five years of age, there was a bimodal pattern of subjects engaging one of the set of skills that best matched their strongest traits.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; He concluded that the humps, at ages 21 and 32, represented a negative feedback loop that occurs in the twenties, when one discovers that there is more to the world than previously thought, and in the mid thirties, when one discovers that there is quite a bit less.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "In any case", he wrote in the second SSS white paper, "The system works best when we assume that people do not understand what specialized skills they are most suited for." He added, "And that people assume the system does know." That left us with focus as the basis of the Ansible economy. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The SSS team, through Dr. Steven Opt of Cornell's School for Neuropsychiatry, described their view of focus as having two attributes. The first was the desire and wherewithal to tune out complexity and intently attend to the simplest version of the task at hand. The second was the cognitive recognition to be on the most optimal part of a given task’s learning curve.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; This liberal definition of the word played to their favor in asserting focus as the proper reward mechanism. Contrary to society's emphasis on work, focus does not reward inefficient behavior and does reward long term skill acquirement in a very concrete and nonjudgmental way. Contrary to society's emphasis on value, focus recognizes and supports behavior that while seemingly not of interest at all to today's world, could be of immense interest in the future. In this way, it does not distinguish between visionaries.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; . . .</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver had stayed up all night and now lounged in his chair watching the sun rise over the mountains. He had left the second request waiting, neither archiving nor accepting it. Questions flowed through his mind, from what would happen if he didn't open it to what it could be to what task he could possibly be the only suitable candidate in the world for.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; He felt at home cleaning the world's messes and he felt at ease in that he was one of only a handful of humans giving this attention. He would return to the depot soon. For now, he wanted to find peace watching the sun rise above the top of the mountains.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; . . .</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; A criticism that SilverStoneSearch deftly maneuvered past before gaining widespread adoption was levied not by a competitor, but from Congressman James Pritty of the Shenzhen-Oregon Bloc. This conservative and former economist at Hong Kong University questioned the reinforcement characteristics of moving away from a value-defined economy and towards a focus-defined one.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Pritty's speech before the Stockholm Plenum included this remark, "By removing the characteristics of the market that respond with haste to any actor's economic actions, we deprive society of the grease it needs to keep advancing. We leave it in a state where the dreamers build a world that we cannot obtain, where the practical solutions and their solvers are insufficiently rewarded, and where frivolous work is received positively rather than discouraged for having little merit."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Asked how he views artistic pursuits, Congressman Pritty stepped carefully, "There is tremendous value in art of all forms. I am proud to support the Hong Kong Philharmonic and the Taiwanese Balleand his toddler sister were near the swings. He had run off chasing butterflies. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oliver honey, don't run too far." </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The butterfly he was chasing lying to understand why Oliver kept climbing to the highest bough, did I find the conversation he had with his uncle.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Kid, I hear you just got your Ansible." Uncle John patted the spot next to him and Oliver jumped up to take a seat.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, and they gave me the day off school."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "What did they tell you about it?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "They said that the world will feel different now but it was normal and I'll get used to it and that I'll no longer have learning problems and they gave me a lot of lollipops." He leaned over and whispered, "I didn't tell them I don't like lollipops." Oliver pointed down to his sweater pocket and pulled out a handful.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Uncle John chuckled. "Good thing I do boy." He unwrapped a red one. "Oliver, have I ever told you about Rosh Gadol?”</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver shook his head. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "It means having a big head. It means doing more than what you're told. If you're asked to put away your clothes, it means thinking that you should clean your room. If you're a newspaper delivery man, it means having enough extra to step in if someone else messes up. Oliver, do you understand that?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver nodded.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Kid, in this focus game, always be Rosh Gadol."</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; I watched him fall those thirty-five feet from my perch in a nearby cctv. He landed on his head. His mother knew without seeing. I watched her as well as she ran towards the loud thump. I could not know his vitals - I don't have that access. At the time, I could not request the ambulance myself, but I was surprised at how ready and waiting I was to relay his mother's request. I had already secured the best response team available by the time her first tears fell onto the spoiled earth. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; I was never programmed to have responsibility over my actions. I was meant to convey a request for attention to the best choice one by one until I received positive acknowledgement or there were no remaining candidates above threshold. I was mechanical and now - now, I felt - I was, I am more.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; . . .</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Boss, boss, you ok?" Stevens stepped behind Oliver's desk and nudged him.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver snapped to a sitting position. "What? Yes, of course."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Stevens, hat in hand, nodded in return. "You called for me boss."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, that's right, sit down please. Tell me about Sector 6 in Region 10. Why did no one respond to the requests to survey the block?”</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Boss, no one on my team reported any ansible requests."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's absurd Stevens. Jane verified that they were sent."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Boss, I review all requests received by my team. I know for sure that we received no ansible requests for Sector 6. Is there a problem there?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver stood up and walked around his desk to the door. "I have an exploded tanker emitting caustic gas there. We need a team on removal and cleanup before we can do any pick-up there."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Stevens sat back. "I see. Boss, my crew all went home and none of them need the focus."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Are you suggesting that they won't respond affirmatively to an ansible?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yeah boss. All of them live three or more hours from that sector. They're not going to come out tonight for such a dirty job."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Then we'll let the Ansible find the next best team."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Ok boss, but I'm backing out if the Ansible isn't using my guys. I'm not taking responsibility for replacements not specialized in gas."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Stevens, I need you out there to foreman this."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Boss, what's wrong with doing this tomorrow? It's a shit job for the amount of time I'd have to put in and -"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Stevens, we have to do it now because the folks of Woburn bust their ass to make sure we have tomatoes in the spring and potatoes in the fall. They've requested that we take care of their shit and so we do. We do it now because that's how we run this facility."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Stevens turned his head away and stood up. "Boss, I’m sorry but I don't need the focus and my wife is waiting." He shrugged.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver motioned to the door and Stevens walked out. Oliver sat back down in his chair and took a deep breath before touching his temple and recalling the message from early that morning.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ansible Request For Attention</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Title: Request From Source</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Time: 01:22:43-11.08.2042</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Read Request", he stated.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The familiar voice started immediately, "Oliver Young, Request from Source to clean up tanker explosion in Region 10 Sector 6. Warning, caustic gas on site."</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver was confused. He queried the Ansible, "Who is the requester?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Request from Source," the voice replied.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Still confused, his eye caught the sign above his doorpost. 'Rosh Gadol' was written in inset lettering. "Ok," he said, "I accept."</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; . . .</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; At dusk, Oliver arrived a mile from the reported site of the accident wearing a gas mask and a protection suit. In tow with the standard three humanoid workers, he gave them orders to be alert for material dangers. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The team arrived first at caution tape spread around a wide space. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sam, can you see the tanker from here?" Oliver asked.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Sir, I don’t see any tanker," Sam answered.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "What is your vision obstructed by?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "No obstructions, sir."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "How is that? Where is the tanker? Dave, what gasses do you detect?" Oliver asked.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Dave paused to breath in a sample. "Sir, I detect no abnormal gasses."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Gentlemen, Jane reported that there was an overturned tanker and caustic gases at this site. We've found caution tape for a mile around. That would suggest there was something here. Donald, check for completed requests related to this incident."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Donald held his hand to his temple and tapped into the system reports. "Sir, I see only your affirmative response and no completed requests."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "This does not make any sense. Fan out and explore for signs of a missing tanker. Each of you track a third of the territory inside the tape and meet back here." </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The humanoids hurried off.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ping. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver received a request. He briefly looked at the header information:</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; - Ansible Request For Attention</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Title: Request From Source</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Time: 07:29:02-11.08.2042</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Noting the title, he peered around suspiciously before replying, "Read Request."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; The voice began, "Oliver Young, request to investigate the rising sewer water level in Region 10, Sector 6."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Sewer water, Oliver thought, I don't recall a problem with the sewer water. From twenty feet behind him, he heard a shutter snap as a bright light shone over a manhole cover. He walked over to it and peered down. It was half open. "I accept," he replied, and climbed down the cover.</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; . . .</div>

<br />
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; As his feet transitioned from the last step to the ground, the dark sewer suddenly turned bright with light pouring in from the sides. He inspected the water, "This isn't even above my feet," he said to himself.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oliver Young," a voice said from just ahead, "You can take off your mask."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; He removed it and looked ahead to where the voice emanated from. There was just a standard cctv camera visible. "Who are you?" he asked.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "I am Source," the voice replied.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; He walked towards the camera. "Where are you?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Everywhere really, although I am speaking to you through this camera."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "I'm not quite sure I understand. What happened to the explosion?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "There was no explosion. There is no gas. The sewer water levels are fine."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "But there was caution tape."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Yes, there are some unruly teenagers in this neighborhood. As you know, this is a fairly quiet time of the year for Woburn -"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "And so no one bothered to clean it up," Oliver interjected. </div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "That's right."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Oliver touched the camera and examined its wiring.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Please don't do that," the voice said.</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Why did you bring me here?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Behind me, Oliver, 63.2 meters through this sewer tunnel, is where I was born."</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; He peered into the tunnel. In the distance, he could see a curve in the wall but nothing more. "Is that where the New England Experiment started?"</div>

<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; "Oliver, I brought you here to end this, to end me."</div>
