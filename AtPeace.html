<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Ten days ago, I was hit by a bus. It did not kill me, though. Nope, what did me in was the shovel I was holding that went flying in the air and fell on my head as I landed from the impact. I thought I was a goner for sure.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
Nine days ago, I found myself sitting on this chair at this table with a large headache, a bump on my forehead, and a really poor memory. Also, none of my friends were picking up when I called.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
Eight days ago, I woke up at the table having cried myself to sleep. I kept visiting the fridge but never wanted to eat. I thought about going to get a smoothie but could not remember how to get to where I could not remember what I was going to get when I said that thing about the thing there in the room with the other thing that's soft and big and like a second floor but much more comfortable.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
Seven days ago, I rationalized my anger at my so-called friends by deciding that Judy was a slut and probably sleeping with Jack, my best friend from 2nd grade. And neither of them were picking up because they were afraid I knew. And Bill was probably out of town on business slash pleasure. Chris was in Tahoe of course and Jacqueline was working long hours and hand't been home. Whatever, I thought. I really did think that and not say it out loud. "Not like I care." That part I said out loud though.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
Six days ago, I was past crying because it hurt so much and more curious because the bump had made no signs of healing. Still not hungry, but was drinking lots of tea. It was warming and the smells reminded me of a full english breakfast.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
Three days ago, I realized that I hadn't spoken to anyone in at least two days. So I wrote this line and contemplated the upsetting relevance of my existence. That order might be reversed. Hmm, but I'm still contemplating my unfortunate existence. Language is unfamiliar at this point.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
Two days ago, I realized that I may not be alone, but I have no ambition to meet more of my ilk, whatever that may be. I sometimes imagine that there are communities for everyone, places to go, people that will join and share like-minded experiences. If you only know where to go, you will have no problem carving a spot of your own because it has already been done for you. Then I think of how terrible that existence would be. To carve my own spot, path, territory, land, to find my own way, this is one of life's treasures. Perhaps, though, this is not a treasure for some people. It's quite possible that midgets with phantom limbs take great solace in having their own mecca. Wait, do they?</div><div></div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
Yesterday, I thought of what came before. For a brief rapture, my memory stormed back and a thunderstorm, a torrent of my past, erupted in my mind's eye. My mother rushing into the pool when my brother nearly drowned. I felt my bones shiver that day when I saw the look of pain in her eyes. In her apron with the chicken stains bleeding into her pants, she dove in and in one fell swoop, scooped his flaccid body out of the water. The embarrassment that spring day in kindergarten when I accidentally broke the cage of the class pet and Hammy the hamster scurried out like a prisoner fleeing bars of plastic and pellets of crap. The kiss I shared with Judy at the high school ball. Last dance of the night and she asked for my hand. I felt like a billion bucks and then I swelled up with pride, confidence, and a dry martini, shaken, when I kissed her on the lips so passionately that she left her feet and fluttered her eyes upon landing. The fight with cancer. It took my hair, it took my fire, it took my soul and desire, but fucking eh, I beat that devil back from this sanctuary and reclaimed life. I showed up ever since. The bike ride across the country. I saw a scared and lonely wolf in Montana, and a scarred and lovely bull in Texas. The dancing fire spinners in Seattle and the irish rain singers in Boston. I quenched my thirst in the mountain streams and swallowed a firehouse in the river's rushing seams. And then I stopped when I saw her.</div><div>&nbsp; &nbsp;
And today, I felt a weightlessness that comes with peace. I was in a church and a vision came to me. It was a girl and she asked me how she should live and I replied, "At peace." And I was.</div>
