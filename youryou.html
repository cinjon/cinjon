<template name="youryou">
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; When you were young, I think it was eighteen, I saw you standing near the shore. I was at the pier and your silhouette was enough for me to exhale your name from the reservoir between my heart and lungs.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; You meandered like a lioness after being promoted to huntress. It was a sight with the setting sun bobbing its reflection on the water and you throwing your hips at the same sauntering pace. I watched you walk that shore towards me and stop just short of hollering distance.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; It was shortly after that, about a year, that your paws scratched after me. I love you today like a man who has found his mate, but then I just wanted you in my bed. I idolized your body, the silky folds that overlayed your glow and moved in tune with my touch, the gentle but affirming purrs that echoed when I caught the temple behind your ear.</div>
<div>&nbsp; &nbsp; Do you remember the night we almost watched the french movie about playing games? We tried to, but I just remember my attention turning from loving your body to loving your you. It was all at once that you were more important than me. As I watched you sleep, I imagined an intruder breaking through the door. I imagined you being scared and I couldn&rsquo;t live with that. I imagined standing strong and saying no, saying leave, saying this with fists, and beating back the man that would come between me and the girl I loved, you.
